## üö® **When You Get Stuck or Discouraged**

### **Week 1-2: "This is too hard, I'm not improving"**
**Remember:** You're building a foundation. Progress isn't always visible immediately.
**Action:** Focus on consistency, not perfection. Celebrate showing up and trying.

### **Week 3-4: "I'm making mistakes and feel embarrassed"**
**Remember:** Mistakes are data, not failures. Native speakers make mistakes too.
**Action:** Keep a "mistake journal" and learn from each one.

### **Week 5-8: "I feel like I'm plateauing"**
**Remember:** Plateaus are normal in language learning. Your brain is consolidating skills.
**Action:** Add more challenging practice or find new conversation partners.

### **Week 9+: "I'm better but still not where I want to be"**
**Remember:** Fluency is a journey, not a destination. Compare yourself to where you started.
**Action:** Set new, higher-level goals and celebrate how far you've come.
