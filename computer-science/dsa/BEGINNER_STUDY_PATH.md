## 🎯 **STUDY STRATEGIES**

### **📚 Daily Study Routine:**
1. **Review (15 min)** - Recap yesterday's learnings
2. **Learn (30-45 min)** - Read new topic or concept  
3. **Practice (60-90 min)** - Code problems in both languages
4. **Reflect (15 min)** - What did you learn? What's next?

### **🔄 Practice Approach:**
1. **Read the problem** carefully
2. **Think about patterns** - Does this look familiar?
3. **Start with brute force** - Get any solution working
4. **Optimize** - Can you do better?
5. **Code in both languages** - Compare approaches
6. **Explain out loud** - Teach it to yourself

### **💡 Learning Tips:**
- **Don't rush** - Understanding > speed
- **Code everything** - Don't just read, implement
- **Use both languages** - Compare syntax and approaches  
- **Explain patterns** - "This is two pointers because..."
- **Track progress** - Keep a simple log of problems solved

---

## 🆘 **WHEN YOU GET STUCK**

### **😰 "I don't understand the problem"**
1. Read the problem 3 times slowly
2. Look at the examples carefully
3. Try to solve a simpler version first
4. Ask: "What is the input? What is the output?"

### **🤔 "I don't know how to start"**
1. Try the brute force approach first
2. Ask: "What patterns do I know?"
3. Draw the problem out on paper
4. Start coding something, anything

### **🐛 "My code doesn't work"**
1. Test with the given examples
2. Add print statements to see what's happening
3. Check edge cases (empty input, single element)
4. Compare with the provided solutions

### **😫 "This is too hard"**
1. You're learning something new - this is normal!
2. Take a break and come back later
3. Review the fundamentals again
4. Remember: every expert was once a beginner
