```
🛠️ Week 1 Project Complete: Task Management API

Just deployed my first production-ready Spring Boot application! After 10 years in legacy Java systems, diving into modern Spring Boot has been eye-opening.

🎯 What I Built:
• RESTful API with full CRUD operations for project management
• JWT-based authentication with role hierarchy (USER/MANAGER/ADMIN)  
• PostgreSQL with connection pooling (HikariCP optimization)
• Docker containerization with multi-stage builds

🔧 Key Technical Decisions:
• Chose Spring Security 6 for its OAuth2 resource server support
• Implemented custom validation annotations for business rules
• Used Testcontainers for integration testing with real PostgreSQL

📊 Performance Results:
• Response time: 180ms → 42ms (after query optimization)
• Memory usage: 40% reduction with GraalVM compilation hints
• Test coverage: 87% including integration tests

The transition from traditional WAR deployments to containerized microservices has been the biggest mindset shift. Spring Boot's auto-configuration eliminated 60% of my usual boilerplate.

🔬 Deep Dive: React State Management Patterns

**Customized Version:**
```
🔬 Deep Dive: React State Management - Redux Toolkit vs Zustand

After building 3 different React apps this month, here's my real-world comparison:

🏗️ The Scenario:
E-commerce dashboard with user auth, product catalog, shopping cart, and real-time notifications.

**Redux Toolkit Approach:**
```typescript
// Store setup with RTK Query
export const api = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'api',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/api/',
    prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
      headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${getState().auth.token}`)
      return headers
    },
  }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getProducts: builder.query<Product[], void>({
      query: () => 'products',
      providesTags: ['Product'],
    }),
  }),
})
```

**Zustand Alternative:**
```typescript
interface StoreState {
  products: Product[]
  cart: CartItem[]
  addToCart: (product: Product) => void
  fetchProducts: () => Promise<void>
}

export const useStore = create<StoreState>((set, get) => ({
  products: [],
  cart: [],
  addToCart: (product) => 
    set((state) => ({ cart: [...state.cart, { ...product, quantity: 1 }] })),
  fetchProducts: async () => {
    const products = await api.getProducts()
    set({ products })
  },
}))
```

📊 Real-World Results:

| Aspect | Redux Toolkit | Zustand |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Bundle Size | +45KB | +8KB |
| Setup Time | 2 hours | 30 minutes |
| Boilerplate | Medium | Minimal |
| DevTools | Excellent | Good |
| TypeScript | Complex | Simple |

💡 My Conclusion:
- **Redux Toolkit**: Perfect for complex apps with multiple developers
- **Zustand**: Ideal for smaller teams and rapid prototyping

Currently using Zustand for personal projects and RTK for work projects.

What state management approach has worked best for your team?
